# KOA Database
**Last Updated: Sept 1 2021**

Work is *in press* and a complete version of the KOA database will be made available here.

This database contains experimental and estimated KOA values that we could identify in the literature including those from PhD dissertations. Information in this database includes the identity of the chemical for which the KOA is reported, the temperature of the value, the methodology used, the original citation and a score on the quality of data.


By default the latest version of the database is called by the functions. Currently there is only one version of the database.


This database is complete to the best of our knowledge as of May 2021. A few papers with KOA values (experimental or estimated) have been published since this time:

1. Feng, J.-J., Sun, X.-F., Zeng, E.Y., "Measurement of octanol–air partition coefficients for liquid crystals based on gas chromatography-retention time and its implication in predicting long-range transport potential," Chemosphere **282**, 131109 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131109

2. Abraham, M.H., Acree, W.E., "Descriptors for fluorotelomere alcohols. Calculation of physicochemical properties," 1–6 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1080/00319104.2021.1888094
