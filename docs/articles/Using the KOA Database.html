      <div class="hidden name"><code>Using the KOA Database.Rmd</code></div>

    </div>

    
    
<p>This package was created to make the <em>K</em><sub>OA</sub> database by <em><a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1063/5.0059652">Baskaran et al. 2021</a></em> easily accessible and searchable. The data is stored as a SQL database however the functions will allow users to extract specific data. There are three main types of functions included. <em>Get</em> functions provide a list of variables that users may find helpful in running queries. <em>Table</em> functions which pulls all data from a specific table within the database. <em>Query</em> functions search and summarize data from the entire database.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">koadata</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="co">#load the koadata package</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In all functions, the version of the database can also be specified. By default, they all use the latest version (and currently only version) of the database. If there are multiple versions of the database, they can be called and specified using the <em>ver</em> parameter.</p>
<div id="get-functions" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#get-functions" class="anchor"></a><em>Get</em> Functions</h1>
<p>The <em>Get</em> functions included here are to extract information that could be useful in querying the database where exact matches are necessary. No parameters for these functions need to be specified. Below we have outlined the information provided by using these <em>Get</em> functions.</p>
<div id="chemical-categories" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#chemical-categories" class="anchor"></a>Chemical Categories</h2>
<p>Each chemical (or mixture) included in the database is listed in the chemical table of the database, however the categorization is simplified and is non-exhaustive. For example 1,4-Dichlorobenzene (CAS No. 106-46-7) is categorized as a chlorobenzene however is arguably also a Haloarene. These categorizations are intended for the purpose of improving the accessibility of the database for common chemical categories including PCBs, PAHs, PBDEs, and so on.</p>
<p>The <em>get.categories</em> function provides a list of unique chemical categories included in the database.</p>
</div>
<div id="citations" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#citations" class="anchor"></a>Citations</h2>
<p>Similar to the <em>get.categories</em> function, the <em>get.citations</em> function provides a list of citations for all references included in the database.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-groups" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#research-groups" class="anchor"></a>Research Groups</h2>
<p>Based on the authors for each publication, we have assigned each reference to a research group. These groups are simplified, and as with the nature of research, some have worked collaboratively on various publications. Typically references from similar groups will utilize similar methods for measuring or estimating <em>K</em><sub>OA</sub>. A unique list of reference groups in the database can be obtained by using the <em>get.groups</em> function</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="table-functions" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#table-functions" class="anchor"></a><em>Table</em> Functions</h1>
<p>The <em>K</em><sub>OA</sub> database contains multiple tables including chemical, methodological, reference, author, <em>K</em><sub>OA</sub> tables. Each of the tables can be extracted by using <em>table</em> functions. Below is a schematic of the <em>K</em><sub>OA</sub> database from <em><a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1063/5.0059652">Baskaran et al. 2021</a></em>.</p>
<p><img src="Figure3.png"></p>
<p>Each of these tables contain specific data and can be extracted using <em>table</em> functions. For example, if you want to take a look at the Reference Table you would use the function ref.table().</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="co">#table.ref()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This data frame contains 155 observations (rows) and 7 variables (columns). Here is a small subset of what the <em>references</em> variable output looks like.</p>

<a href="#extracting-subsets-of-data-using-table-functions" class="anchor"></a>Extracting subsets of data using <em>Table</em> functions</h2>
<p>Some of these <em>table</em> functions allow you to extract a subset of data. For example, from the references table, we can identify all citations from the Harner group.</p>

<code class="sourceCode R">

<code class="sourceCode R">
<span class="co">#table.ref(query = c("Harner", "Carr"))</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>Table</em> functions that allow for subsetting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>table.chem() — specify the chemcial category/categories (“PCBs”, “PAHs”, etc.)</li>
<li>table.meth() — specify the type of method (“Dynamic”, “Static”, “Indirect”, “EST”)</li>
<li>table.ref() — specify the research group (“Harner”, “Carr”, “Abraham”, etc.)</li>

<li>Chemical Name (as listed in the database)</li>
<li>Temperature (°C) of the <em>K</em><sub>OA</sub> value</li>
<li>log<sub>10</sub><em>K</em><sub>OA</sub> value</li>
