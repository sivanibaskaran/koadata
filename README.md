# *K*<sub>OA</sub> Database

**Last Updated: Sept 1 2021**

Work is *in press* and a complete version of the *K*<sub>OA</sub>
database will be made available here.

This database contains experimental and estimated *K*<sub>OA</sub>
values that we could identify in the literature including those from PhD
dissertations. Information in this database includes the identity of the
chemical for which the *K*<sub>OA</sub> is reported, the temperature of
the value, the methodology used, the original citation and a score on
the quality of data.

By default the latest version of the database is called by the
functions. Currently there is only one version of the database.

This database is complete to the best of our knowledge as of May 2021. A
few papers with *K*<sub>OA</sub> values (experimental or estimated) have
been published since this time:

1.  Feng, J.-J., Sun, X.-F., Zeng, E.Y., “Measurement of octanol–air
    partition coefficients for liquid crystals based on gas
    chromatography-retention time and its implication in predicting
    long-range transport potential,” Chemosphere **282**, 131109 (2021).
